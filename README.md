From Module 7: Created Tables based on ERD MAP

# Deliverable 3: 
### Purpose given at top of README 
### Results
* From the unique table, it can be concluded that the highest unique title among the retiring employees are Senior Engineers.
* Additionally, approximately 50% of retiring employees are Engineers  
* The role with the least employees was the Manager role among the retiring employees. 
* Even after filtering the dataset, it's more evident that there are some missing values. 


### Summary 


2. I would say that there are more than enough retiring employees to mentor upcoming employees because in the image shown below: 
![total employees mentorship](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116187123/211223693-7d0ea4bd-ed5b-4263-a377-a2e9efe67200.png)
It shows that there are 1549 eligible employees, and according to the departments table as shown below: 
![dept](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116187123/211223333-3fc63145-0a86-4cdf-807b-faad37828a83.png)
there are a total of 9 departments. 
If you divide 1549/9, you get approximately 172 mentors per department. I think that one of the major disadvantages to this, is that we won't know for 
sure on whether or not retiring employees would choose to articipate in the mentorship program, so that could possibly lessen the number of mentors per department, 
and that could be tricky because it depends on the number of new employees and their hire dates.
